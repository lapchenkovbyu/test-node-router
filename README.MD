# NodeJS simple router
##### NB! only for educational purposes

 - To use this module, just require router as follows:
 `const router = require('./router')` 
 - Then, register your routes as follows:
 `router.register('METHOD', 'path', hadlerFunction)`
 HandlerFunction must accept 2 parameters (`request` and `response`), and return a valid HTTP request.
 - 404 Error handling is built-in.
 - Run your server with `node index.js` (or wherever you want to place the usage to)
 
 ###### You can find usage example in `index.js` file
